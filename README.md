# Sonic4_Tools

The latest version of the programs can be found on [AppVeyor][appveyor_artifacts] (including dependencies).

More or less suitable for use versions are planned to be published on GitHub's release page.

------------

## Old Mod Conversion Tool

This program is a tool that converts old mods to make them work properly with the mod loader.

It also can convert **sound and music mods**.

**You need the game to properly convert mods.**

## AMA Editor

A tool for modifying AMA files. It can change relations, possition, size and UV coordinates of 2D sprites (such as buttons and other HUD).

Currently can properly edit only ~10% of all files in both episodes.

## TXB Editor

It can properly edit all TXB files. On the other hand, we have no idea what these values mean.
