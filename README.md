# Sonic4_Tools

The latest version of the programs can be found on [AppVeyor][appveyor_artifacts] (including dependencies).

More or less suitable for use versions are planned to be published on GitHub's release page.

------------

## Old Mod Conversion Tool

This program is a tool that converts old mods to make them work properly with the mod loader.

It also can convert **sound and music mods**.

**You need the game to properly convert mods.**

## TXB Editor

An advanced-limited hex-editor for integer and floating-point numbers per byte. Mostly useless at this moment. You can try to use it with other formats as well.
